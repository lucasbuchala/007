# 007 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/masak/007.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/masak/007)

007 is a small language created as a testbed for Perl 6 macros. Its goal as a
language is to inform the implementation of macros in Perl 6, by means of being
a faster-moving code base and easier to iterate on towards good solutions.

Rakudo already contains a rudimentary implementation of macros, but at this
point the most mature macro implementation for Perl 6 is embodied in 007.

The name "007" was chosen because the data type representing program fragments
is called `Q`.

## Get it

You need to have [Rakudo Perl 6](https://perl6.org/downloads/) installed and in
your path.

Then, clone the 007 repository. (This step requires Git. There's also [a zip
file](https://github.com/masak/007/archive/master.zip).)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/masak/007.git
[...]
```

## Run it

Set the `PERL6LIB` environment variable:

```
$ cd 007
$ export PERL6LIB=$(pwd)/lib
```

Now this should work:

```
$ bin/007 -e='say("OH HAI")'
OH HAI

$ bin/007 examples/format.007
abracadabra
foo{1}bar
```

## Status

007 is currently in development.

The explicit goal is to reach some level of feature completeness for macros in
007, and then to backport that solution to Rakudo.
